Male peafowl are referred to as <b>peacocks</b>, and female peafowl are referred to as <b>peahens</b></p></div>

The third peafowl species, the Congo peafowl, is native only to the Congo Basin. Male peafowl are known for their piercing calls and their extravagant plumage. The latter is especially prominent in the Asiatic species, which have an eye-spotted "tail" or "train" of covert feathers, which they display as part of a courtship ritual.</p></div>
                     <div class="ch8">The functions of the elaborate iridescent coloration and large "train" of peacocks have been the subject of extensive scientific debate. Charles Darwin suggested that they served to attract females, and the showy features of the males had evolved by sexual selection. More recently, Amotz Zahavi proposed in his handicap principle that these features acted as honest signals of the males' fitness, since less-fit males would be disadvantaged by the difficulty of surviving with such large and conspicuous structures.</div>

                       <br><p>The <a href="Indian peacock">Indian peacock</a> (Pavo cristatus) has iridescent blue and green plumage, mostly metal-like blue and green. In both species, females are a little smaller than males in terms of weight and wingspan, but males are significantly longer due to the "tail", also known as a "train".[1] The peacock train consists not of tail quill feathers but highly elongated upper tail coverts. These feathers are marked with eyespots, best seen when a <a href="peacock">peacock</a> fans his tail. All species have a crest atop the head. The <a href="Indian peahen ">Indian peahen </a> has a mixture of dull grey, brown, and green in her plumage. The female also displays her plumage to ward off female competition or signal danger to her young.</p></br></div>

                        <p>Male green peafowls <a href=" (Pavo muticus)"> (Pavo muticus)</a> have green and bronze or gold plumage, and black wings with a sheen of blue. Unlike Indian peafowl, the green peahen is similar to the male, but has shorter upper tail coverts, a more coppery neck, and overall less iridescence. Both males and females have spurs.[2][page needed]</p></div>

                        <p>The Congo peacock <a href="(Afropavo congensis)">(Afropavo congensis)</a> male does not display his covert feathers, but uses his actual tail feathers during courtship displays. These feathers are much shorter than those of the Indian and <a href="green species">green species</a>, and the ocelli are much less pronounced.

                     <div class="17"><p>Further information: Iridescence and <a href="structural colouration">structural colouration</a>
As with many birds, vibrant iridescent plumage colors are not primarily pigments, but structural coloration. Optical interference of Bragg reflections, from regular, periodic nanostructures of the barbules (fiber-like components) of the feathers, produce the <a href="peacock's colors.">peacock's colors.</a>[5] Slight changes to the spacing of the barbules result in different colors. Brown feathers are a mixture of red and blue: one color is created by the periodic structure and the other is created by a Fabry–Pérot interference peak from reflections from the outer and inner boundaries. Color derived from physical structure rather than pigment can vary with viewing angle, causing iridescence.[6</p></div>
